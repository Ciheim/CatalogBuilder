How to test:

The catalog builder wrapper accepts two arguments: an input path where data is stored and an output path to which the final CSV file will be generated.

In order to overwrite any existing CSV file at the given output path, the  '--overwrite' flag can be used.
In order to append any existing CSV file at the given output path, the  '--append' flag can be used.

The following example generates a sample catalog called ‘output.csv’ to the home directory: 
/gen_intake_gfdl.py /archive/am5/am5/am5f3b1r0/c96L65_am5f3b1r0_pdclim1850F/gfdl.ncrc5-deploy-prod-openmp/pp ~/output.csv

NOTE: Currently only time series output files are included in output CSV.
